# odin-recipes
First Official Odin Project

The aim is to build a basic website using just html. 

A quick summary of the journey so far;

1. I now know how to navigate around my system using the CLI(Command Line Interface)
2. I now know difference between git and github as well as how to intergrate both applications into my development workflow
3. I have a better understanding of html elements and the functions.

I'm very happy with how much i've learnt, even though I know the real challenges haven't started yet I'm really looking forward to it
